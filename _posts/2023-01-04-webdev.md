## Hello World!
This has been my new year plan for too long. At last, in 2023, my personal website is online!   Welcome!

### TL;DR

Building website is always one of my hobbies. 
It had occupied my to-do list for years and I was always waiting for some spare time.

At my junior year of college, I built my first public available site for [2014 NTU Math Camp](http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/~camp/2014/) using Abode Dreamweaver + Apache.
Later in 2016, I participated the construction of our new departmental website for [NTU MATH](http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/about-website). 
That is a big project built with Drupal. 
Since then, I have been looking for options for my personal site. 
It must be something having enough degree of freedom, moden enough for different browsers and mobile devices, easy to publish and maintain articles, and most importantly, free. So far, my choise is Jekyll + Chirpy theme + GitHub Pages.

The primary purpose of this website is to be an extension of my resume as a cheat to keep my CV within 3 pages. 
Other than that, I will use this site to document a bit of my life, some attempts of trying new things, and some learning notes. 
Most of the posts will be written in English (I guess...) but I will try to introduce my research works in Taiwanese Mandarin to fill some language gap. The idea is inspired by the forum [TW Community](https://forum.community.tw/about).


## Construction Logs

This very first post will also be used to document what I have changed.       
The backend is scary complicated, but the modification is relatively easy.

- Jekyll with theme [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) jekyll-theme-chirpy v4.0.1
- favicon ![pebble](/assets/img/favicons/android-chrome-512x512.png){: width="20" height="20" text-align=center} is a cell from my pebbles bed mesh 
- avatar
- layout    
   - "tab" layout is cloned from "post" to have toc, 
   - call layout "page-tab" from "page.html" to remove "Treding tags"

- sidebar.html
   - home: redirect to about
   - blog: copy "home-blog" layout from "home" to call "post-paginator.html".
     Following the discussion from here: [issue#711](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/issues/711)

- Upgrade to jekyll-theme-chirpy v5.4.0   
  This resolves the issue that image won't show up properly when not using post/page layout
  - ruby 3.0 (3.1 fails to build somehow)
  - switch to github action

## Issues
