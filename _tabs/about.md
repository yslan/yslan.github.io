I am Yu-Hsiang Lan (First name: Yu-Hsiang, Last name: Lan[^tw-name]), or 藍鈺翔 in Taiwanese Mandarin, born and raised in Taiwan.    

My master's research at National Taiwan University (NTU) was my first venture in the field of numerical PDEs. 
Later in 2017, I was lucky to be invited to Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) as a summer student. 
It was my first high-performance computing (HPC) experience and it's very satisfying to run my own code at scale. I enjoyed it a lot. 
After getting my master's degree in applied math, I had been continually working at Argonne as a pre-doctoral appointee for three years. 
Now, I'm back to school and currently being a computer science student at University of Illinois working toward a doctoral degree.
