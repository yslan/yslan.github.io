I am Yu-Hsiang Lan (First name: Yu-Hsiang, Last name: Lan[^tw-name]), or 藍鈺翔 in Taiwanese Mandarin, born and raised in Taiwan.    

My master's research at National Taiwan University (NTU) was my first venture in the field of numerical PDEs. 
Later, I was lucky to have been invited to Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) as a summer student. It was my first high-performance computing (HPC) experience and I enjoyed it a lot. 
After getting my master degree in applied math, I had been continually working at Argonne as a pre-doctoral appointee for three years. 
Now, I'm back to school and currently being a computer science master student at University of Illinois working toward a doctoral degree.

[^nek5000]: [Nek5000](https://nek5000.mcs.anl.gov) is an efficient scalable open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver using spectral element method (SEM) and [NekRS](https://github.com/Nek5000/NekRS) is its GPU variant. They both target large scale turbulence simulations on supercomputers.
